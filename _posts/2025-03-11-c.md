    - text: " Our reward functions assess the geometric consistency of intermediate generated video frames by computing the feature similarity of upscaled DINO features. (a) GS-MEt3R evaluates feature similarity between the original video frames and their corresponding rendered images from 3DGS. (b) Dyn-MEt3R unprojects background features from half of the video frames and reprojecting them onto the remaining frames to compute feature similarity."
