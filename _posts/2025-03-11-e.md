    - text: "Our main result is that VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement. We also validate the effectiveness of our proposed dual-stream architecture and asynchronous sampling strategy in improving the joint distribution modeling of multi-view images and camera poses for text-to-3D generation (Please see our paper!)."
